# Statement on Gen AI

Gen AI Chat Prompts that I used

* Can ggplot be combined with real-world map layers?
* I have the latitude and longitude data, can I use them to control the map display range?
* Can I put two lists? like the neighbourhood list on the left and street list on the right

Reflection: I feel compared with using Google search to find the correct functions that I want, ChatGPT is a much more convenient way to do it. It has the following pros

* No need to check if the function will work before putting it into use. Normally it will work, which helps to save a lot of time;
* Besides providing the possible solutions, it can help to decide which one will work the best;
* It has the memory of the chat history, so it has the context for the follow up questions.
